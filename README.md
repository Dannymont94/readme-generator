## Description
When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions.

Readme Generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README based on the user's response to a few prompts. This means that developers will have more time to devote to their projects!

## Installation
To install dependencies, run the following command:

Here is a short [demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TsK2L01-ddLsjpLZHnWRmylf_M9MSykp/view) to help you use the Readme Generator.
